# Interactive Map Dashboard

This project is a web-based interactive map dashboard that allows users to visualize geographic locations and dynamically display relevant information based on user interaction. The map features a clickable interface where users can select areas, and the sidebar provides contextual information for the selected location.

## Features

- **Interactive Map**: An embedded map using Folium and Leaflet.js, allowing users to explore different geographic locations.
- **Dynamic Sidebar**: A sidebar that displays detailed information related to the selected location on the map.
- **Location-Based Data Fetching**: On map click, the application fetches data based on the selected coordinates and updates the sidebar with relevant information.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Flask
- Folium
- Geopy (optional: for reverse geocoding)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/map-app.git
   cd map-app
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the application:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

4. Access the application in your browser:

   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:5000/
   ```

## How It Works

- **Map Display**: The map is centered on a default location (e.g., London) with zoom controls enabled.
- **Click Event**: When a user clicks on the map, the app fetches location-specific data based on the clicked coordinates.
- **Sidebar Update**: The sidebar dynamically updates to show information about the selected area.

## Technologies Used

- **Flask**: Backend framework for serving the web application.
- **Folium**: Python library for generating interactive maps.
- **Leaflet.js**: JavaScript library powering the interactive map.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Frontend technologies for rendering the map and sidebar.

## Future Improvements

- Enhance data retrieval by integrating with external APIs.
- Add support for additional map layers and advanced geographic analytics.
- Implement search functionality for quickly locating specific regions.
